## Osaka – The Kitchen of Japan

Osaka is Japan's second-largest metropolitan area, known for its modern architecture, energetic nightlife, and incredible street food culture. The city offers a less formal and more vibrant alternative to Tokyo, brimming with neon lights and historical landmarks.

### Dotonbori at Night

The Dotonbori area is a sensory overload and a spectacular subject for street and night photography. The reflections of huge illuminated billboards—including the famous Glico Running Man—shining on the canal waters are quintessential Osaka.

### Osaka Castle

Surrounded by a moat and a park with plum, peach, and cherry trees, Osaka Castle provides a striking contrast between 16th-century history and the modern skyscrapers rising behind it. It is particularly beautiful in the spring and autumn.
