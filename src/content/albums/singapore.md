## Singapore – A City in a Garden

Singapore is a dynamic island city-state in maritime Southeast Asia, blending ultra-modern architecture with extensive green spaces. From its diverse cultural enclaves of Chinatown, Little India, and Kampong Glam to the stunning sci-fi horticulture of Gardens by the Bay, the city is a photographer's playground.

### Gardens by the Bay

The iconic Supertree Grove and the massive glass biodomes—the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest—offer incredible photo opportunities, especially during the evening light shows when the Supertrees come alive with dazzling colors.

### The Historic Quays

Along the Singapore River, Clarke Quay and Boat Quay contrast beautifully with the towering skyscrapers of the Central Business District in the background, making it an excellent location for blue-hour and cityscape photography.
