## Grigin Farm – Wild Wales in the Cambrian Mountains

Grigin Farm sits deep in the heart of mid-Wales, surrounded by the ancient upland landscape of the Cambrian Mountains. This is Wales at its most elemental — wide skies, bracken-covered hillsides, and the sound of curlews carrying across the valley.

### The Landscape

The farm sits within one of the least populated areas of Wales, where traditional hill farming has shaped the land for centuries. Ancient field boundaries, dry-stone walls, and scattered oak woodland give the area a timeless quality that is increasingly rare in the modern countryside.

### Photography

The light in mid-Wales has a quality unlike anywhere else in Britain. Low cloud rolling in from the west, sudden breaks of golden afternoon sun, and the drama of approaching storms all make for endlessly changing conditions. Red kites are a common sight overhead, and the surrounding moorland supports a rich variety of upland birds.

### Getting There

Grigin Farm is located in Powys, accessible via the mountain roads of the Cambrian range. The nearest town is Rhayader to the east. The area is best explored by car, with many unmarked lanes leading to the open hill country above the valley.
