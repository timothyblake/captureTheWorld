## Mount Fuji – Shooting Japan's Sacred Peak

At 3,776 metres, Mount Fuji is Japan's highest mountain and one of the most instantly recognisable silhouettes on earth. It has been venerated as a sacred site since at least the seventh century, inspiring countless woodblock prints, poems, and pilgrimages. For contemporary photographers, it remains one of the world's great compositional subjects – its perfect cone providing an anchor for almost any foreground element.

### The Fuji Five Lakes

The Fuji Five Lakes (Fujigoko) district to the north of the mountain provides the classic views most people picture. Lake Kawaguchiko is the most accessible and offers multiple celebrated vantage points, including the much-photographed pagoda at Chureito in nearby Fujiyoshida. Lake Yamanakako, to the east, is a favourite among landscape photographers for its reflection shots at dawn.

### Photography Highlights

Fuji is notoriously shy: cloud cover obscures the summit on roughly 60% of days, even in the clearest seasons. The two optimal windows are from late October to late November (before snowfall becomes heavy) and from late January to late February (when the snowcap is at its most defined and the air is at its driest). The phenomenon of 'Diamond Fuji' – the sun appearing to rest on the summit – occurs twice yearly and draws photographers from across Japan.

### Getting There

Direct highway buses run from Shinjuku Station, Tokyo, to Kawaguchiko in approximately two hours. The Fuji Excursion limited express train from Shinjuku is a more comfortable option. JR Pass holders should note the pass is not accepted on this route and a supplement is required.
