## Tarragona – Shooting Roman Catalonia
Tarragona sits on a limestone bluff above the Costa Daurada, and for two centuries it served as the capital of the Roman province of Hispania Tarraconensis. The evidence is everywhere: an amphitheatre carved into the cliff-face overlooking the sea, a 1st-century circus whose vaults run beneath the medieval old town, an aqueduct that marches across a pine valley six kilometres to the north.
### The Archaeological Sites
The UNESCO-listed Roman remains are concentrated in a compact area. The amphitheatre is the most dramatic – its arena floor still visible, the sea forming a backdrop that few Roman sites can rival. The Praetorium tower, once the ceremonial heart of the provincial capital, now houses a small museum and provides sweeping views across the rooftops to the harbour.
### Photography Highlights
The quality of light in Tarragona is exceptional. The town faces south-east, meaning the old city catches the warm directional light of early morning and is largely shaded by afternoon – ideal for architecture photography. The Roman circus vaults beneath Plaça del Rei are particularly rewarding: shafts of light cut through ventilation gaps in the ceiling, creating natural spotlighting effects. The Pont del Diable aqueduct, 25 minutes' walk north of the city, is best photographed at dawn before the tour buses arrive.
### Getting There
Tarragona is on the main AVE high-speed line between Barcelona (35 minutes) and Valencia (90 minutes). From the train station, the old town is a steep 20-minute walk or a short taxi ride uphill.
