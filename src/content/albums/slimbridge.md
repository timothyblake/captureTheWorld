## WWT Slimbridge – Where Wildlife Photography Was Reinvented

The Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust centre at Slimbridge is the site where Sir Peter Scott founded the modern wildlife conservation movement. Established in 1946 on the low-lying meadows and tidal mudflats of the Severn Estuary, it remains one of the world's most important wetland reserves – and one of the finest places in Britain to photograph wading birds, wildfowl, and migratory species at close range.

### What to Expect

The reserve holds over 25 species of wildfowl in its managed grounds, including flamingos, cranes, and several endangered species bred here for reintroduction programmes. The real spectacle, however, arrives each winter when tens of thousands of wild birds descend on the estuary: Bewick's swans from Siberia, white-fronted geese from Russia, and vast flocks of lapwing and golden plover.

### Photography Highlights

Slimbridge's hides give photographers a significant advantage: birds here are habituated to human presence and will feed at remarkably close range. The Zeiss hide overlooks a feeding pool where kingfishers are regularly photographed. The Estuary Tower provides elevated views across the Severn mudflats at high tide, when waders are pushed into dense, dynamic flocks.

### Getting There

Slimbridge is located off the A38 between Gloucester and Bristol, approximately 13 miles south of Gloucester. It is not well served by public transport; most visitors arrive by car. WWT membership provides free entry and is recommended for repeat visitors.
