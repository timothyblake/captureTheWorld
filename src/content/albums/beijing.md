## Beijing – Ancient Capital of China

Of the many sections of the Great Wall open to visitors, Mutianyu offers what Badaling cannot: genuine solitude. Located 70 kilometres north-east of Beijing in a valley of dense deciduous forest, this stretch of wall winds along a steep ridgeline for approximately 2.25 kilometres, with 22 watchtowers in various states of repair and restoration.

### A Structure Built Over Centuries

The wall you walk at Mutianyu was largely built during the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644), though the foundations in places rest on earlier Northern Qi construction from the sixth century. The section was designed specifically to protect the capital and is consequently one of the most robustly constructed: the outer battlements are unusually high, and the inner parapets are themselves crenellated – allowing defenders to fight in retreat.

### Photography Highlights

The visual drama of Mutianyu comes from its topography. Unlike flatter sections, the wall here rises and falls with the natural contours of the Yanshan Mountains, creating compositions with natural leading lines at almost every angle. Autumn colour, typically peaking in mid-October, transforms the forest below into a sea of amber and red. Low cloud and morning mist are common, particularly in spring, lending the scene a classical Chinese ink-wash quality.

### Getting There

Buses depart from Dongzhimen bus station in Beijing to Huairou, from where local minibuses run to Mutianyu village. Private taxi hire from central Beijing takes approximately 90 minutes. A cable car and toboggan run are available for those who prefer not to hike the steep access path.
