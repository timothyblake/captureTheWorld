## Chiang Mai – The Rose of the North

Nestled among the lush mountains of Northern Thailand, Chiang Mai is a city of ancient Lanna culture, hundreds of intricate Buddhist temples, and vibrant night markets. The pace here is much slower than Bangkok, making it a peaceful retreat for cultural photography.

### The Old City Temples

The moated historic center is home to incredible temples like Wat Phra Singh and Wat Chedi Luang. The golden stupas, intricate wood carvings, and saffron-robed monks offer rich, colorful subject matter.

### Doi Suthep

Perched on a mountain overlooking the city, Wat Phra That Doi Suthep is one of the most sacred sites in Thailand. The winding journey up the mountain and the panoramic views of Chiang Mai below are breathtaking, especially in the early morning light.
